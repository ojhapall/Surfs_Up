## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to query temperature data to determine if the ice cream shop was sustainable all year round. Specifically we were asked to query the months June and December over many months. 

## Results
The results of this query showed that the mean temperature in June was 74 degrees and in December it was 71. In addition the max temperature in June was 85 and December it was 83. This shows that the temperature seems to be relatively similar throughout the year. However, the minimum temperature in December can drop to 56 whereas the minimum temperature in June is 64. This may affect sales as December seems to get colder, though the average temperature is close.

## Summary
Based on  the results, we can conclude that the ice cream shop is likely to be successful all year round. Potentially with minor reduced sales and profits in December due to the lower minimum temperature. 

To further assist this analysis, it would be beneficial to run a query on the percipitation data. As an increased amount of percipitation in one of the months could also result in reduced sales. 

It may also be beneficial to understand the trend over the years. As the climate changes it would be important to note if the trend of the temperatures are consistent or declining during a certain period of time. This would predict if the ice cream shop would not only be successful year round but also year after year.
